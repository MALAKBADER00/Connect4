# Connect 4 Game

An implementation of the classic Connect 4 game featuring two gameplay modes:  
- **Human vs Human**  
- **Human vs AI** (powered by the MiniMax algorithm).  

The game uses **Pygame** for visualization and provides an engaging experience with smooth graphical interactions. The AI leverages adversarial search to make optimal moves, ensuring a challenging and competitive game.

## What is the MiniMax Algorithm?  
The MiniMax algorithm is a decision-making process used in game theory and AI. It evaluates all possible moves to minimize the maximum potential loss (or maximize the minimum gain). In this game, it allows the AI to anticipate the player's strategy and select the best move to win or block the opponent.
